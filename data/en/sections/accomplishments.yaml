  courseOverview: "This course provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a key field in linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. It focuses on algorithms for interpreting and manipulating human language to analyze massive textual data. Main content:
(i) Classical techniques: Logistic regression, naive Bayes, word vectors, and locality-sensitive hashing.
(ii) Probabilistic models: Dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and embeddings for spelling correction and syntactic analysis.
(iii) Neural networks: LSTM, GRU, and attention mechanisms for text generation, named entity recognition, and duplicate detection.
(iv) Advanced models: Encoder-decoder architecture, causal attention, and self-attention (T5, BERT) for translation, summarization, and question-answering."
